            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho brown trout involves noting several key characteristics. Brown trout typically have a brown or golden-brown coloration with 
                darker spots scattered across their bodies, which often have a halo of lighter color around them. These spots are more concentrated towards the upper 
                body and back, with fewer spots on the lower sides. Additionally, brown trout have a slightly more robust and elongated body compared to other trout 
                species, with a squared-off tail.

                Brown trout generally occupy specific types of habitats that suit their need for cooler, well-oxygenated water. They are most commonly found in fast-moving streams, 
                rivers, and high-oxygenated areas. These environments provide the necessary conditions for their survival, including abundant food sources and suitable spawning grounds. 
                It is less likely to catch brown trout in slow-moving bodies of water, as these do not typically provide the same levels of oxygen and habitat complexity that brown trout 
                prefer. By targeting these dynamic and oxygen-rich environments, anglers can increase their chances of successfully locating and catching brown trout.
