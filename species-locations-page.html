            <h1 class = "species-title">Brown Trout</h1>

            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho brown trout involves noting several key characteristics. Brown trout typically have a brown or golden-brown coloration with 
                darker spots scattered across their bodies, which often have a halo of lighter color around them. These spots are more concentrated towards the upper 
                body and back, with fewer spots on the lower sides. Additionally, brown trout have a slightly more robust and elongated body compared to other trout 
                species, with a squared-off tail.

                Brown trout generally occupy specific types of habitats that suit their need for cooler, well-oxygenated water. They are most commonly found in fast-moving streams, 
                rivers, and high-oxygenated areas. These environments provide the necessary conditions for their survival, including abundant food sources and suitable spawning grounds. 
                It is less likely to catch brown trout in slow-moving bodies of water, as these do not typically provide the same levels of oxygen and habitat complexity that brown trout 
                prefer. By targeting these dynamic and oxygen-rich environments, anglers can increase their chances of successfully locating and catching brown trout.

        <div class="species-2">
            <h1 class = "species-title">Rainbow Trout</h1>
            <img src = "fishing-images\rainbow-trout.png" alt = "rainbow trout" width = "500px" height = "700px">
            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho rainbow trout involves noting several key characteristics. Rainbow trout are known for their striking coloration, 
                which includes a broad pink to red stripe running along their lateral line from gills to tail. Their bodies are generally silver to greenish in color, 
                covered with small black spots that extend onto their dorsal fins and tail. The coloration can vary depending on their environment and diet, but the 
                distinctive red stripe and the speckling are reliable identification markers.

                Rainbow trout in Idaho are mostly introduced by fish farms, which stock them in various bodies of water to support recreational fishing. These farm-raised 
                fish are well-adapted to the local conditions and provide a popular target for anglers.

        <div class="species-3">
            <h1 class = "species-title">Cutthroat Trout</h1>
            <img src = "fishing-images\cutthroat-trout.png" alt = "cutthroat trout" width = "500px" height = "700px">
            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho cutthroat trout involves noting several key characteristics. Cutthroat trout are named for the distinctive red 
                or orange slash marks on the underside of their lower jaw. Their bodies typically have a golden or yellowish tint, with dark spots concentrated 
                towards the tail and fewer spots on the head. These spots are irregular in shape and size, giving the cutthroat trout a unique and easily recognizable appearance.

                Cutthroat trout in Idaho generally occupy specific types of habitats that suit their need for cooler, well-oxygenated water. They are most commonly 
                found in fast-moving streams, rivers, and other high-oxygenated areas. These environments provide the necessary conditions for their survival, including

                increase their chances of successfully locating and catching cutthroat trout.

                It is important to note that cutthroat trout are illegal to harvest in Idaho. This regulation is in place to protect the species and ensure their populations 
                remain healthy and sustainable. Anglers must practice catch and release when fishing for cutthroat trout, handling them carefully to minimize stress and injury 
                before releasing them back into the water. By adhering to these guidelines, anglers contribute to the conservation of this valuable native species.

        <div class="species-4">
            <h1 class = "species-title">Largescale Sucker</h1>
            <img src = "fishing-images\largescale-sucker.jpg" alt= "a largescale sucker" width = "500px" height = "700px">
            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho largescale sucker involves noting several key characteristics. Largescale suckers have a robust, elongated body with a broad head and a 
                downturned mouth designed for bottom feeding. Their coloration is generally olive to brown on the back, fading to a lighter, yellowish underside. They have large 
                scales, especially noticeable on the lower half of their body, which gives them their name.

                Largescale suckers typically inhabit slow-moving streams, rivers, and lakes where they feed on algae, detritus, and small invertebrates. Unlike fast-moving water 
                preferred by trout, these environments suit the sucker's bottom-feeding habits. Despite their different habitat preferences, largescale suckers are an integral part 
                of Idaho's aquatic ecosystems.

                It is crucial to note that largescale suckers should not be removed from the water. Unfortunately, they are often confused with the invasive common carp, leading some
                people to catch them and leave them on the bank to die. This practice is harmful and unjustified, as largescale suckers have every right to be in the water as trout do. 
                While they are not considered good eating and are occasionally used as bait, they play a vital role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats.

                Anglers should handle largescale suckers with care, ensuring they are promptly and safely returned to the water if caught. By respecting this native species and 
                recognizing their importance, anglers contribute to the health and diversity of Idaho's waterways. It's essential to correctly identify and protect largescale suckers, 
                promoting sustainable fishing practices and preserving the natural environment for future generations.

        <div class="species-5">
            <h1 class = "species-title"> Bass *Largemouth* </h1>
            <img src = "fishing-images\large-mouth-bass.avif" alt = "largemouth bass" width = "500px" height = "700px">
            <p class = "species-paragraph">
                Identifying a native Idaho largemouth bass involves noting several key characteristics. Largemouth bass are easily recognized by their broad, horizontal mouths 
                that extend past their eyes when closed. They have a greenish to olive coloration with dark, horizontal stripes along their sides. Their bodies are robust and 
                streamlined, built for powerful swimming and predatory behavior.

                Largemouth bass typically inhabit warm, slow-moving waters such as lakes, ponds, and sluggish streams. They prefer areas with abundant vegetation, submerged logs, 
                and other structures that provide cover and ambush points for their prey. These environments offer the ideal conditions for largemouth bass, which are top predators 
                in their habitats, feeding on smaller fish, insects, and amphibians.

                It is important to note that largemouth bass should not be removed from the water unless they are intended for consumption. While they are popular among anglers for 
                their sport and the challenge they present, largemouth bass play a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of their habitats. They help control populations 
                of smaller fish and contribute to the overall health of the aquatic ecosystem.

                Anglers targeting largemouth bass should practice catch and release whenever possible to ensure sustainable populations. If an angler does choose to keep a bass, it 
                should be done following local regulations and guidelines to avoid overharvesting. By handling largemouth bass carefully and respecting their role in the ecosystem, 
                anglers can help preserve these valuable fish for future generations.

                Additionally, largemouth bass are not only prized for their sport but are also excellent table fare when properly prepared. They provide a delicious and nutritious 
                option for those who enjoy cooking their catch. Ensuring that fishing practices remain sustainable and responsible will help maintain healthy populations of largemouth 
                bass, benefiting both the environment and the fishing community.
